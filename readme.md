# Day13 Task | Cohort 2.0  

This project is a fashion-inspired single-page layout showcasing a **Sweaters Collection**, created as part of the Shreyians Coding School Cohort 2.0.  
It is built using **HTML and CSS** to practice layout, typography, absolute positioning, and custom font usage.  

## 📌 About the Project  
The task was to design a **product showcase webpage** that includes:  

- A navigation bar with left, center, and right links  
- A large central heading styled with a custom font  
- Product details section describing material and features  
- A bottom bar highlighting a collection call-to-action  
- Positioned product images placed artistically on the page  

This project helped me understand:  
- Using `@font-face` to import and apply custom fonts  
- Applying absolute positioning for text and images  
- Structuring a webpage with navigation, content, and footer sections  
- Layering elements with `z-index` for overlapping effects  
- Maintaining layout without overflow issues  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – structure and semantic content  
- **CSS3** – styling, positioning, and fonts  

## 🚀 Features  
- Custom font styling for headings and navigation  
- Large, bold product category title for emphasis  
- Absolute-positioned images to create a collage-style layout  
- Clear product details and material information  
- Bottom section with "New Collection" and call-to-action link  

## 📖 Learning Outcome  
By completing this task, I strengthened my **CSS positioning skills**, practiced working with **custom fonts**, and learned to combine **typography and imagery** for a clean, fashion-style landing page design.
